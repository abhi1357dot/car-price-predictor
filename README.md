ðŸš— Car Price Predictor Web App

A machine learning web application that predicts the price of a car based on features like mileage, fuel type, engine capacity, and more. Built using **Linear Regression** and deployed with **Flask**.

ðŸ§  Project Overview

This project demonstrates how a machine learning model can be trained and integrated into a real-world application using Flask. It takes user input via a web form and returns predicted car prices in real time.
